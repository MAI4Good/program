# Master's in Artificial Intelligence for Good Program

**MAI4Good** is an educational program launched by the **Humanitarian AI** meetup community. The community links local meetup groups in fifteen cities, bringing students, researchers, AI developers and tech companies together to discuss applications of artificial intelligence with humanitarian actors and work on volunteer projects.

The MAI4Good **project** aims to establish a professional master's degree level certificate program in **artificial intelligence** tailored specifically for staff from humanitarian organizations seeking to becoming sufficiently proficient in aspects of computer science and artificial intelligence to be able to work collaboratively with others on AI for Good initiatives.

## Google CoLab Notebooks

The program will be developed around the use of Google CoLab notebooks for instructional content.

## Classes

Initially classes will concentrate on providing students with foundational lessons on **Artificial Intelligence**, **Mathamatics**, **Python Programing**, **Algorithms** and subjects like **Generative AI and Large Language Models**.

Subject matter will be covered from a high-level for humanitarian actors under pressure to gain foundational knowledge and basic practical skills. Certificats of completion will be awarded based on engagement and feedback instead of exams. Students will be expected to study course materials, provide feedback, pose questions, assist others and establish for themselves code and notes to takeaway from the program.

## Partners

The program will rely on volunteers to help develop and improve course content and insitutions to provide program-level input and assistance.

## Get Involved

The program will be accessible to new students on an academic quarter-by-quarter basis. The program is free to attend however students will be charged a small fee to cover resources and program coordination and to motivate participation.

To participate in the program as a student, volunteer or partner, contact program coordinators via team(at)humanitarianai.org.
