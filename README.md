# MAI4Good Program

MAI4Good is an educational program launched by the Humanitarian AI meetup community linking local meetup groups in fifteen cities. Humanitarian AI meetup groups bring students, researchers, AI developers and staff from tech companies together to discuss applications of artificial intelligence with humanitarian actors and work on volunteer projects.

The MAI4Good project aims to establish a certificate program for staff from humanitarian organizations interested in becoming sufficently proficent in computer science and AI to be able to work collaboratively with others on AI for Good research initiatives and test projects.
