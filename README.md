# Master's in Artificial Intelligence for Good Program

**MAI4Good** is an educational program launched by the **Humanitarian AI** meetup community. The community links local meetup groups in fifteen cities, bringing students, researchers, AI developers and tech companies together to discuss applications of artificial intelligence with humanitarian actors and work on volunteer projects.

The MAI4Good **project** aims to establish a professional master's degree level certificate program in **artificial intelligence** tailored specifically for staff from humanitarian organizations seeking to becoming sufficiently proficient in aspects of computer science and artificial intelligence to be able to work collaboratively with others on AI for Good initiatives.

The project was launched by former United Nations staff to address the need to **streamline**, **improve** and **reduce** the cost of educational resources accessible to humanitarian actors able to rapidly provide students new to computer science with a **technical grounding** in AI and a **basis** for understanding advancements being made in the field and applicational possibilities.

## Google CoLab Notebooks

As developed, the program will use [Google CoLab Notebooks](https://colab.google/) for pedagogical **instruction** and **student engagement**. Because students and volunteers alike can interact with one another through shared course notebooks, comment on content, pose and respond to questions and collaboratively make edits and additions to the notebooks, the program will be able to organically improve its courses, capture and integrate information of contextual importance to humanitarian actors and adapt courses to emerging thematics needing to be covered.

The use of CoLab Notebooks will enable the program to engage students around AI through learning, experimentation, questioning and answering and the building and improvement of sharable resources rather than through conventional teaching, self-study and testing.

## Classes

While under development, the program will concentrate on generating [courses](https://github.com/MAI4Good/program/tree/main/notebooks#readme) to evaluate covering four main subjects: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Basics, Math and Python Programing, Algorithms and Generative AI.

The program will undertake to tailor courses towards providing staff from humanitarian organizations with a minimum, sufficient level of understanding and practical skills needed to constructively participate in discussions on AI and take part in organization research and projects involving developing and testing applications of AI and large language models.

The program will be accessible to new students on an academic quarter-by-quarter basis. The program is free to attend. However students will be charged a small monthly fee to cover digital resources and program coordination. Certification of course completion will be awarded to students based on participation and engagement. Students are thus expected to study course material, provide feedback, pose questions, assist others and contribute to improving the program's course notebooks.

## Partners

The program will rely on volunteers and students to help develop and improve course content and on insitutions and tech companies to provide program-level input and assistance.

## Get Involved

To participate in the program as a student, volunteer or partner, contact program coordinators via **team**(at)**humanitarianai.org**.
